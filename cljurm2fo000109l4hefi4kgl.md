So you have created a website on your computer? Great! Now, we come to the following problem: how to make it accessible to the public?

There are many great options for web hosting (we call them PaaS), and they also offer a free account to get you started without losing any money.

I created a PaaS where it should take less than ten clicks (less than 10 minutes) to set up any website over the Internet. Let's get it started:

## First Step: Create an Account

Go to [domcloud.co](https://domcloud.co/) and create an account using Google/GitHub Sign In. With 3rd party sign-in, you don't have to confirm your email to get in.

After that, a welcome page will be shown. Click **Create a Website**.

## Uploading a website

This page contains two modes: **Start from a template** or **Upload or clone from the Internet**. We choose the latter.

The next step is to drop your project folder into the uploader, then choose what's the kind of framework you're using in that project, [like this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0WFk-qh2Cc0):

Then fill in the unique name, website region, also with a custom domain name (if you own one), then click **Add a website**. (Read more about [using a custom domain](https://domcloud.co/docs/features/dns))

## Done!

The next screen tells the progress as it happens in almost real-time. It should only take a few minutes.

After it is finished, your website should be accessible over the Internet!

## Continue Editing

Continue editing the website online via tools like an online file browser and Visual Studio Code remote development using SSH (my favorite). [Read more about it in the documentation](https://domcloud.co/docs/intro/getting-started#managing-website).

If your website setup comes into a problem, there is [a tool to check its connection](https://domcloud.co/blog/improving-ux-for-newbies#connection-check-api). It should be able to troubleshoot common HTTPS and DNS problems.

That's it! I hope this brings new excitement into learning website development. Let me know what you think about it ðŸ¤“
